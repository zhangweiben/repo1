	09/02/2016		Mike Tinius			7.0.3			Added the ability for the 3 procedures to impersonate a service account when invoked from a users&apos; query tool like Toad or DB Visualizer.
	08/29/2017		Mike Tinius			7.0.4			Modified to support queued, single-threaded file/view generation.  Added queue file clean-up capability.
	09/25/2017		Mike Tinius			7.0.4			Fixed several issues after roll-out to PROD revealed issues.
															01_ExecuteDML
																1. Increased &quot;status&quot; parameter length from 20 to 100 to match the metadata definition.
															cleanupDynamicViews
																1. File not associated with username.  Occurred when lookup of CIS_DYNAMIC_VIEW_QUEUE returned no rows.  Added a fall-back username/email lookup.
																2. Added double quotes around table name and table path if needed to be consistent with add and remove.
																3. Modified dynamic SQL to allow for file names with single quote.
															dynamicViewQueueInsertRequest
																1. Modified dynamic SQL to allow for file names with single quote.
															dynamicViewQueueProcessRequest
																1. Added Organization, Project, and Subproject to the subject line and body of the email.
																2. Change subject line for add file to use table path URL instead of file name.
															listDynamicFile
																1. Very inefficient and slow.   Rewrote implementation to capture CIS metadata once and reuse within the getFileInfo loop.
															manageDynamicViews
																1. Added double quotes around table name and table path if needed to be consistent to allow user to copy and paste for their SQL statement.
															removeDynamicFile
																1. Added double quotes around table name and table path if needed to be consistent to allow user to copy and paste for their SQL statement.
															Helper/removeTable
																1. Added double quotes around table name and table path if needed

	02/20/2018		Mike Tinius			7.0.5			Added to ASAssets Best Practices.
														Renamed methods to have consistency: 
															dynamicFileCleanup, dynamicFileCreate, dynamicFileList, dynamicFileRebuild, dynamicFileRemove
