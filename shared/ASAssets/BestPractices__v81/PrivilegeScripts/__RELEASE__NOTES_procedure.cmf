	--------------	------------------	------------	-------
	01/30/2015		Mike Tinius			6.2.6			Added &apos;getPrivilegeDatasourceToScriptMapping&apos; which maps a datasource type to a formatting view or script which invokes that datasource connection.
														Added &apos;updateResourcePrivilegesDriverV3&apos; which contains the Datasource parameter.  
														Added Datasource parameter to existing published procedures that are not as widely used.
	11/18/2014		Mike Tinius			6.2.6			Updated all published procedures to use scalar output variables to coordinate with PDTool capabilities to display output variables.
	... many changes that were not tracked
	Mar 2014		Mike Tinius			6.2.6			Created new
	01/15/2016		Mike Tinius			7.0.2			updateResourcePrivilegesDriverV3
														1. added additional parameters to updatePrivilegeCategory. 
														2. Fixed bug where 1st privilege was not being applied because it was getting the LINK COLUMN instead of the 1st level lineage view.
														3. Retrieve columns from system.COLUMN_NAMES instead of the procedure getBasicResourceCursor_SQL_TABLE.
	01/18/2016		Mike Tinius			7.0.2			validatePrivilegesDriver
														1. Fixed validatePrivilegesDriver to retrieve 1st level lineage privileges instead of LINK COLUMN privileges.
														2. Added validatePrivilegesDriver feature to get privileges outside the intended list and throw an exception based on whether they were not revoked properly.
														3. Fixed bug to not throw an error on resources not found.  Added bypassErrors=[0|1]
	02/02/2016		Mike Tinius			7.0.2			validatePrivilegesDriver
														1. Fixed bug to not throw an error on resources not found. 
	05/24/2016		Mike Tinius			7.0.3			Added procedure getCurrentTimestamp to workaround a bug introduced by 7.0.3 server when setting CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.

	06/30/2016		Mike Tinius			7.0.3			Modified Revoke All code to only set actual Privileges and not inherited privileges since inherited cannot be changed.
														Modified insertNewPrivileges_MBUPI to return more message output.
														Modified get_Composite_Resource_Privileges to be able to handle a comma-separate list of Resource_Path with wild-card &quot;%&quot;.
	07/16/2016		Mike Tinius			7.0.3			Moved &quot;insertNewPrivileges_MBUPI&quot; to the MBU_PROCESS_INSIGHT folder.

	01/31/2017		Mike Tinius			7.0.4			Removed all references to removeDoubleQuotes, emptyStr, convertYN, returnFolderNameAndFolderPath, and getDelimitedOccurrence in order to reduce the the number of procedure calls.
															Put in conditional logic to directly call RegexReplace only when required instead of removeDoubleQuotes.
	02/07/2017		Mike Tinius			7.0.4			Removed all but two occurrences of RegexSplit to reduce the number of iterations of invoked procedures.	 
															RegexSplit is still used in updatePrivilegeReadFoldersV4 and validatePrivilegesDriverV4 due to logic requirements.	
															Deprecated updateResourcePrivilegesDriverV3 and get_Composite_Resource_Privileges and related Helpers procedures.											  
	03/09/2017		Mike Tinius			7.0.4			Modified vPrivileges_All_Excel_Load and vGroups_All_Excel.  Added AND LENGTH(TRIM(columnname)) &gt; 0 for both to filter out blank rows with spaces in key columns.
															For vPrivileges_All_Excel_Load, moved the where clause filter from outside the UNION to inside the UNION and placed on all three SELECT statements.
	04/12/2017		Mike Tinius			7.0.4			Modified &quot;ModifyPrivileges&quot; to add table maintenance for various supporting tables in the database.
	05/03/2017		Mike Tinius			7.0.5			Added &quot;Name Type&quot; filter to various procedures.  Changed SheetType to Organization in various vPrivileges_... views.
