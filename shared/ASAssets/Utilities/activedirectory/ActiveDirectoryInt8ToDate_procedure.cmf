  <annotation>ActiveDirectoryInt8ToDate:

  Active Directory represents some Date values internally as an Integer8, which 
  translates to a BIGINT. The number represents the number of 100-nanosecond 
  intervals since 12:00 AM January 1, 1601. In addition, the fact that the CIS 
  function UTC_TO_TIMESTAMP() uses 1/1/1970 as its base date must also be accounted 
  for in the conversion.

  
Please note, Active Directory stores dates using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT),
  or a GMT offset of 0. The function supports converting the date value according 
  to the number of hours that the local time zone is offset from GMT.
 

	Input:
		ADInt8 - Active Directory integer8 value  
			Values: Any AD Integer8 (BIGINT) value

		GMTOffsetInHours - Offset (in hours) from GMT  
			Values: -12 to 12


	Output:
		ADDate - The Active Directory date converted to an ANSI date
			Values: Any date value from 1600-12-31 onwards


	Exceptions:  N/A
