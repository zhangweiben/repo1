  <annotation>returnColumnOrderingString:

	This procedure generates an ORDER BY string with the numCols numbered columns. It is useful for generating an
	ORDER BY clause for use with automated regression testing


	Input:
		numCols - INTEGER
			The number of columns to include in the generated ORDER BY string

			Ex: 10

	Output:
		oorderByString - LONGVARCHAR
			The ORDER BY string

			Ex: ORDER BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

	Exceptions:  none
