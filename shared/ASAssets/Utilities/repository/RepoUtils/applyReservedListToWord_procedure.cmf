    -- CIS Repository Helper Procedure --
    This procedure is used to fix the leading characters and CIS reserved words used in a word. Any word 
    that is a reserved word, has a leading underscore &apos;_&apos; or a number &apos;0123456789&apos;, or has a special
    character must be quoted.  

    This procedure would be called in conjunction with other procedures.  For example, when generating 
    a view based off of another view, the SELECT statement&apos;s FROM clause would require that the path to 
    the underlying view be fixed with double quotes if it meets any of the quoting criteria above.
 
    Dependencies:
    =============
    $CIS_INSTALL_HOME/conf/customjars/RepoUtils.properties - This properties file on the CIS host filesystem 
        provides a list of reserved words and characters that are used to match with the various parts 
        of a folder path.  Add any new CIS reserved words that appear from release to release in this list. This
        file can be updated without a restart of CIS.

    Input:
        inWord - CIS source folder path to assess and fix
            Values: e.g. XML. If this is NULL, a NULL is returned.

		debug - This input is deprecated but included for backward compatibility.
			Values: Any string value or NULL. It is ignored.

    Output:
        result - Fixed word
            Values: e.g. &quot;XML&quot;

    Exceptions:  none
