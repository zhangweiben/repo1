    DEPRECATED: Will be removed in future release
        Replaced with Utilities/RepoUtils/applyReservedListToWord

    -- CIS Repository Helper Procedure --
    This procedure is used to fix the leading characters and CIS reserved words used in a word. It is assumed that 
    a word is really a portion of a path representing the value in between two slashes &apos;/&apos;. 
    Any word that contains a reserved word, leading underscore &apos;_&apos; or a number &apos;0123456789&apos; must have 
    double quotes inserted around it.  This procedure would be called in conjunction with other procedures.  
    For example, when generating a view based off of another view, the SELECT statement&apos;s FROM clause would 
    require that the path to the underlying view be fixed with double quotes if it finds.
 
    Dependencies:
    =============
    /shared/Utilities/repository/ConfigureReservedList - Provides a list of reserved words and characters
    	that are used to match with the various parts of a folder path.  Add any new CIS reserved words
    	that appear from release to release in this list.

    Input:
        word - The word to assess and fix.  Assumed to be a portion of a folder path.
        	Values: e.g. XML

    Output:

            Values: e.g. &quot;XML&quot;

    Exceptions:  none
