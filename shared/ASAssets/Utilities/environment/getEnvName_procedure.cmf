	-- Custom Function --
	This procedure returns the environment name for this specific server.  It is useful when sending emails to be able to 
		identify the environment type in the subject line giving the recipient a quick way of determining which environment
		is having issues.  It may also be used by procedural logic to perform different logic based on the environment type. 
	It is intended to be modified for each environment.  For a cluster it will have the same value by default because 
		the DV code is duplicated on each server.  The value can be whatever the DV development team wants up to 255 characters.  
	Some examples are shown below:
		DEV=TDV Development environment
		TEST=TDV Test environment
		PROD=TDV Production environment
		DR=TDV Disaster Recovery environment

	** WARNING **: Be aware that when you update the Utilities, you must modify the environment setting again as it will be overwritten.
 
	Input:
		none
	Output:
		envName	- the environment for this specific server
			Example values:  DEV, UAT, TEST, QA, PRE_PROD, PROD, DR
